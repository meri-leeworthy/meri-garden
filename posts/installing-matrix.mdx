Steps that I've taken (following
[this guide](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/tree/master/docs))

- Set up a DigitalOcean droplet with Debian 11, ssh key linked to my machine,
  $12 plan (2GB Ram)
- SSH in to check it has Python 3 installed (it does)
- Install Ansible (pip3 install ansible) on my machine
- Git clone the Ansible playbook from the repo
- configure the playbook

Playbook config

- enable ma1sd
- enable the Signal bridge
- enable shared secret (this makes double puppetting possible)
